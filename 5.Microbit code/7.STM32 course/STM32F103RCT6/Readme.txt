
The hardware wiring diagram shows the STM32F103C8T6 wiring diagram. All wiring of STM32F103RCT6 is the same, and can be connected according to the corresponding pins.

The battery input interface of the driver board is connected to a voltage range of 5V-8.4V.

The input voltage of the VCC pin on the driver board is 3.3V. It is strictly prohibited to connect 5V voltage, otherwise it will puncture the driver board chip.

When connecting serial or IIC wiring, only RX, TX, GND, or SDA, SCL, GDN pins can be connected, and VCC (3.3V) can not be connected.
